NOTES
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1) The algorithm is designed around a 'real' animal shelter. That is, it expects higher amounts of dogs and cats over birds and small pets. It also expects most clients are looking for a dog or a cat. Additionally, the algorithm is designed for a realistic amount of integratable animals. 
2) Scoring:
   -10 < X < 10  - Matchable
   10 < X < 20 - Decent Match
   20 < X < 30 - Good Match
   30 < X < 40 - Great Match
   40 < X      - Amazing Match
3) Matches can be made under -10, however it is unlikely. The range of scores is -32 to 49
